These are my legendary WIP dotfiles (they will prlly be maintained forever!).
They're managed with GNU's `stow` utility.

<p align=center>Please note that this config is not fully completed and that I didn't have time for a proper screenshot.</p>

# Features
This rice is going to undergo a huge remake soon, now that I've got the hang of this. These are the planned features:

- [ ] Top left: workspaces, open apps (->)
- [ ] Top center: (focused) window icon, title bar
- [ ] Top right: systray, sysmonitor, date/time, astro/weather, quick actions
- [ ] Right pane (slide-in): tabs thingy w/ copilot, detailed system monitor, quick tiling arrangement assistant etc.
- [ ] Bottom pane (slide-in): tabs thingy w/ music ctrl + visualiser, astro/weather, date/time + calendar, reminders/alarms, etc.
- [ ] Center: Feature-rich app launcher!
- [ ] Background: wallpaper changes per workspace + date/time + some other sysinfo
- [ ] Last workspace: Dashboard!
- [ ] Easy appearance configuration applet
- [ ] Find a *good* music player (kinda a personal thing)
- [ ] Switch to neovim (also a personal thing)
- [ ] More coming!
